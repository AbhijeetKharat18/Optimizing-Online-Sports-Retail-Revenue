# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue

• Analyzed the data from an online sports clothing company to help improve revenue.

• Found that out of the 3179 products in the database, only one column — last_visited — had more than 5% of its values missing. 

• Compared the price points of Nike and Adidas products and found that Adidas products generate more total revenue regardless of price category.

• Showed that there is a strong positive correlation between revenue and reviews and suggested the company can run experiments to increase reviews.

• Determined that 85% of the company's stock consists of footwear products and that they generate a median revenue of over $3000 dollars.

• Examined how this differs to clothing products and found that clothing products generate a median revenue of around $2500.
